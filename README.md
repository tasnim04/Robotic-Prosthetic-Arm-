The primary objective of this project was to create a prosthetic forearm actuated by servos which resembled the anatomy of the human hand in terms of movements and grasping objects. The designing was done with the target to create a prosthetic which was capable of carrying out day-to-day activities with ease. This included tasks such as grabbing different shaped objects using a range of finger gripping patterns. 
Extensive literature review of leading prosthetic arm designs was carried out as well as open-source designs pushing the boundaries in the prosthetic design field. The design process was entirely carried out in SolidWorks. The designs were then 3D printed using readily available FDM 3D printers and assembled using typical machine tools. 

The target of this prosthetic forearm design was to use the five individually actuated fingers to accomplish the following grip patterns.

A demo video for the 

Version 1 of this prototype had quite a few issues.
